## Introduction

Hello,

I'm interested in game development since long time, but I had never published about this topic until now.

I’ve decided to share a project on GitHub that I’m currently working on as part of my learning process. This game is helping me to build a base with the aim of developing a more robust commercial project in the future.


## The Game

At this stage, the game is quite simple and lacks complex features. However, it includes some core functionalities that could serve as a structural base for a more complete video game.

My plan is to continue updating it in my free time, gradually adding new features.

I’m sharing the link here in case anyone would like to download it to play or use it as a reference for  their own projects. (It’s available for Windows and Linux, click the link for more details)

## Godot

The game engine I’m using is Godot. It’s open-source, and in my opinion, it has made great progress in recent years.

It offers extensive and accessible documentation, and its growing community makes it easier to learn 
and find support.
